> A **decentralized multi-agent system** enabling *autonomous governance, negotiation, and conflict resolution* within a digital economy.  
> Developed as a rapid prototype in **24 hours** during the **Fusion Hackathon 2025** to demonstrate **self-organizing governance** powered by reinforcement learning and adaptive intelligence.

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a **self-evolving governance framework** where reinforcement learning (RL) agents autonomously **propose, enforce, and evolve** governance rules — such as token policies, transaction regulations, and market mechanisms.

The system exhibits **emergent economic behaviors**, including automated negotiation, consensus formation, and reputation-based trust — all without centralized control.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🗳️ **Dynamic Governance System**  
  Agents propose and modify rules using **Reputation-Weighted Quadratic Voting**, ensuring fairness and proportional influence.

- 🤝 **Autonomous Conflict Resolution**  
  Disputes are resolved via **game-theoretic negotiation protocols** (Nash Bargaining), fostering stability and cooperation.

- 🧬 **Adaptive Agents via Reinforcement Learning**  
  Agents continuously learn and adapt to evolving policies and market conditions using PPO in Ray RLlib.

- 📊 **Real-Time Visualization Dashboard**  
  A live interactive dashboard presents governance metrics, agent reputations, proposals, and simulations.
